# Emily Computer (ORM Challenge: E-commerce Back End)

## Description

The back-end for an e-commerce site that uses Express.js API and Sequelize/MySQL database.

Working through this project for over a week now has really helped me understand more about how to develop code for back-end applications. I needed experience with writing routes and whatnot.

## Credits

* Received help from tutors Patrick Lake and Sean Brown-Byfield on this assignment.
* Referenced [this](https://developerhowto.com/2018/12/29/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express-js/) to refresh how Node.js and Express.js worked so that I could use it in my code.
* Referenced [this](https://www.tabnine.com/code/javascript/functions/express/Router/delete) for the router.delete code format and syntax.
